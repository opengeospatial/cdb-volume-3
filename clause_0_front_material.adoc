[big]*i.     Abstract*

This CDB Volume provides terms and definitions.  Many of the terms and definitions are specific to the simulation industry. Other terms and definitions have been updated to be consistent with the ISO 19xxx (Geomatics) series of standards, specifically ISO 19111 Spatial referencing by Coordinates and ISO 19017 Spatial Schema. Some work still remains to make the terms and definitions completely consistent with current OGC and ISO best practice.

[big]*ii.    Keywords*

The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues.

ogcdoc, OGC document, cdb, spatial reference model, srm, coordinate systems, crs, srs
