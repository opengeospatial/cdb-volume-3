| |*Description*
|*A*{set:cellbgcolor:lightgrey} |
|*Aliasing*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |Spatial and/or temporal image defects or artifacts in a raster image. They are due to interaction between the discrete sampling of the raster format and the spatial and temporal frequencies inherent in the computed image of edges, surfaces and point features. Manifestation of spatial aliasing includes edge stair-stepping and crawling, scintillation of narrow surfaces, break-up of long, narrow surfaces and positional or angular motion of scene edges in discrete steps. Temporal aliasing includes double image and loss of dynamic image integrity due to the human eye’s ability to dynamically track individual fields at certain angular rates of motion.
|*Ambient Illumination* |See Illumination, Ambient.
|*Anti-aliasing* |Active image processing techniques that reduce the perception of the aliasing phenomena.
|*AO1* |Angle of Orientation with greater than 1 degree resolution. The angular distance measured from true north (0 deg) clockwise to the major (Y) axis of the feature.
|*Areal Feature* |See Feature, Areal and Polygon
|*Articulated Part* |A child part of a model (usually a moving model) that is allowed some degree of motion with respect to the parent body of the model. Examples of articulated parts include tank turrets, refueling drogues, and helicopter rotor blades.
|*Arithmetic Logic Unit* |An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex

*Base Material Table*

*(BMT)*

 |A data structure that contains a description of the Base Materials available to the CDB. There is only one BMT per CDB. Each entry in the BMT corresponds to a Base Material; the entry associates a name to the Base Material.
|*C* {set:cellbgcolor:lightgrey}|
|*CDB device* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|A device that can directly input synthetic environment data that conforms to the format, structure and conventions of this standard. A device need not input and process all of the CDB datasets and attributes to be CDB-compliant.
|*CDB simulator* |A simulator whose client-devices can input synthetic environment data that conforms to the format, structure and conventions of the CDB standard. Any subsystem or client-device that does not natively conform to this standard requires that CDB data be formatted and structured to the device’s native format and structure through the use of a runtime publisher. A simulator need not input and process all of the CDB datasets and attributes to be CDB-compliant.
|*CDB Translator* a|
An off-line software process that translates an environmental database from its toolset-native format(s) into one of the CDB specified formats.

*NOTE:* The CDB data formats are based on industry standard tool formats; as a result a translation to the formats prescribed by this standard may not be required.

|*CDB Server* |Gateway platform to CDB mass storage and applicable infrastructure. CDB compliant servers access, filter and distribute CDB data in response to requests from the Database Generation Facility (DBGF) and the client-devices (or their runtime publishers).
|*CDB Geocell (tile)* |Region of the earth, aligned to lines of latitude and longitude in accordance with Section 2.1 CDB Core (Volume 1). The size of a CDB Geocell per Zone is also specified in the Core CDB Standard section 2.1. Also known as DGGS Cell.
|*Channel* |A field of view segment within a visual system’s total viewing field for which a corresponding unique scene segment is calculated and presented.
|*Client application* |A software application that requires a complete or partial synthetic representation of the world. CDB applications may require a CDB runtime publisher to convert the CDB compliant database into a form it can directly input. Used interchangeably with “Client-device” in this standard.
|*Client-device* |Simulation subsystems (Image Generators (IGs), Radar, Weather Server, Computer Generated Forces (CGF) Terrain Server, etc.) that require a complete or partial synthetic representation of the world. A CDB client-device may require a CDB runtime publisher to convert the CDB data into a form it can ingest.
|*Coordinate* a|
One of a sequence of n-numbers designating the position of a point (see point) in n-dimensional space.

NOTE In a coordinate reference system, the numbers shall be qualified by units. [adapted from ISO 19111]

|*Coordinate Conversion* |coordinate operation in which both *coordinate reference systems* are based on the same datum
|*Coordinate Reference System* a|
Coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum

NOTE For geodetic and vertical datums, the object will be the Earth. [ISO 19111:2007]

|*Coordinate System* |Set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points (ISO 19111).
|*Composite Material* |See Material, Composite.
|*Composite Material Table* |A data structure that contains a description of the Composite Materials available in a CDB tile or on a model. Each entry in the CMT corresponds to a Composite Material.
|*Coordinate System, Geographic* |A geographic coordinate system (GCS) uses a three-dimensional spherical surface to define locations on the earth. A GCS is often incorrectly called a datum, but a datum is only one part of a GCS. A GCS includes an angular unit of measure, a prime meridian, and a datum (based on a spheroid).A common choice of coordinates is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude[latitude], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude[longitude] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation[elevation] (or altitude)*.* For the CDB, the reference data is based on the WGS-84 ellipsoid, i.e., geographical latitude j and longitude l are the angles of the normal on the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid along the point to the equator and zero meridian. The angles are given as degrees, minutes and seconds. Altitude is the distance above and normal to the ellipsoid in meters. The WGS-84 ellipsoidal earth models provides for accurate calculations over long distances on the earth’s surface.
|*Correlation, Algorithmic* |The degree of informational consistency between the outputs of two or more devices with equivalent Arithmetic Logic Units, each submitted to the same input data. (e.g., consider two devices meshing terrain from a regular grid of elevation points, one using a regular mesh of right-handed triangles using the elevation points as vertices, and the other with a DeLauney triangulated mesh derived from the grid of elevation points).
|*Correlation, Numerical* |The degree of informational consistency between the outputs of two or more devices, each submitted to the same input data, (e.g., two devices computing the sine of an angle, one with a series of 10 terms, and another with an interpolation of a look-up table with 100 entries, or one device using 32-bit signed integers for its internal computations and the other using single-precision floats). The CDB Standard addresses Runtime Source Database numerical accuracy correlation errors because a single representation is used for each data set.
|*Correlation, Parametric* |The degree of informational consistency between the outputs of two or more devices, each submitted to the same input data but to different control parameters (e.g., consider two devices generating regular meshes of right-handed triangles based on a regular grids of elevation points organized by Level-of-Detail (LOD), one using an LOD meshing tolerance parameter of 1m and the other 2m).
|*Correlation, Raw Source DB* |The degree of informational consistency between two or more sets of raw datafootnote:[In this context, raw source denotes any input to the modeling workstation that is used to assemble the synthetic environment; consequently, the data may have undergone some level of post-processing (such as image color-balancing, image ortho-rectification, etc.) or may be in a specific source interchange format (such as SIF, SEDRIS, etc.)] (i.e., inputs to a modeling station) representing aspects of the same environment (for instance, the correlation errors arising from Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) elevation data that does not perfectly match the satellite raster imagery due to oblique view distortions induced by the satellite). Correlation errors are intrinsic to the process of gathering data because there is no means to gather all of the required data from a single device, at a single instant in time. Instead, datasets (e.g., elevation, raster imagery, geometry) are each gathered from various devices of various types, at different times, etc. As a result, this process inherently introduces (raw source) correlation errors.
|*Correlation, Runtime DB* |The degree of informational consistency between two or more runtime databases representing the same synthetic environment. The CDB standard eliminates database correlation errors since only one database is used to represent the same synthetic environment. A runtime database is a device-loadable database format that can be processed by a target device. The CDB Standard defines a format that can be entered in runtime by client-devices that conform to the CDB standard. By definition, the CDB Standard addresses all runtime database-level correlation errors.
|*Correlation, Source DB* |The degree of informational consistency between the internal datasets of a source database produced by a DB generation toolset. To a large extent, the effort expended by a modeler at their DB workstation consists in eliminating (or at least reducing) correlation errors arising from miss-correlated raw source data.
|*Culture* |See Feature, Cultural.
|*Culture, 2D* |Short for 2D Cultural Feature. The 2D representation of a man-made or natural object (such as a road, a runway, a forest canopy), conformed to the terrain.
|*Culture, 3D* |Short for 3D Cultural Feature. The 3D representation of erect man-made or natural object (such as buildings, trees, towers) positioned on top of and usually conformed to the terrain.
|*D* {set:cellbgcolor:lightgrey}|
|*Data Dictionary* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|A data dictionary is a collection of descriptions of the http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data[data] objects or items in a data model for the benefit of programmers and others who need to refer to them. See http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/data-dictionary
|*Data Duplication* |Data logically representing the same information, copied one or more times within a complex data structure. The CDB Standard eliminates all duplication of data, i.e., the data appears once and only once within the CDB structure.
|*Data Normalization* |*Data normalization* is the process of reducing *data* to its canonical form. For instance, *Database normalization* is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational *database* to minimize redundancy and dependency.
|*Data Redundancy* |Information in the form of data that can readily be derived (within the limits of technological/cost reasonability) and re-formatted, or re-derived from other data.
|*Dataset* |In general, an identifiable collection of data. In modelling and simulation, an organized group of related environmental data that cannot be broken down into a smaller set used to describe a synthetic environment element of the world.
|*Database Fidelity* |Reflects the amount and type of synthetic environmental data needed by client-devices to simulate real-world environmental data with greater fidelity. Consider for instance a simulator client-device capable of supporting a single-surface earth skin representation versus one capable of representing a multi-surface earth skin that represent tunnels, bathymetric data, location-dependent tide heights, etc.
|*Database Assembly* |In many database tools, the generation of the terrain plays a pivotal role in the database assembly process because all of the cultural features are conformed and constrained to the terrain representation and structure. Most client-devices in existence today have interdependent terrain geometry, raster imagery and culture; as a result of this, most tools in use today resolve these inter-dependencies during this critical and computationally expensive database assembly step.
|*Database Generation Facility (DBGF)* |A geographically co-located group of workstation(s), computer platforms, input devices (digitizing tablets, etc.), output devices (stereo viewers, etc.), modeling software, visualization software, CDB Server, CDB off-line publishing software and any other associated software and hardware used for the development/modification of the CDB. The DBGF is used for the purpose of CDB creation and CDB updates. Each workstation is equipped with one or more specialized tools. The tool suite provides the means to generate and manipulate the synthetic environment.
|*Database Generation Timeline* |Elapsed time from availability of Environmental DB requirements (geographic extent, fidelity, resolution, etc.) to availability of a compliant runtime Environmental DB, ready for use on all client-devices of a simulator.
|*Database Publishing* a|
A process (either off-linefootnote:[When applied as an off-line process, the term “compilation” is often used instead.] or on-line) where all of differences between the tool-native representation and the client-device internal representation of the synthetic environment database are resolved. During this step, the publisher transforms the assembled database so that it satisfies the client-device’s:

* internal formats
* internal data structure and organization
* internal naming conventions
* internal precision and number representation
* data fidelity requirements (typically parameters that match the client-device algorithms)
* performance limitations
* level-of-detail representation and conventions

|*Database Publishing, Offline* |The process of performing the steps listed above in Database Publishing, and then storing the result in a distinct SE database for each client-device. (Note that the stored databases are different for each client-device type and each vendor type). In many cases, the published databases are proprietary.
|*Database Publishing, Online* |The process of performing the steps listed above in Database Publishing, on-the-fly, based on paging requests of a client-device. Since the publishing is performed on-demand, it exists only momentarily in memory; it is not stored on disk.
|*Database Resolution* |Informational density (for instance, the number of elevation values per km^2^, pixels per km^2^, polygons per km^2^) of a modeled dataset.
|*Data Precision* |Corresponds to the numerical precision (i.e., number of bits allocated) used to represent a unit.
|*Datum* |Parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system.
|*Depth* |Height below the reference surface will have a negative value, which would embrace both gravity-related heights and ellipsoidal heights.
|*DGIWG* |Defense Geographic Information Working Group
|*DGGS* |Discrete Global Grid System: _spatial reference system_ that uses a hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and address the globe. “cell” aka “tile” or ”geocell”

|*E* {set:cellbgcolor:lightgrey}|
|*Elevation* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Synonym for “height”
|*Environmental Data Coding Specification* |An Environmental Data Coding Specification provides a mechanism to specify the environmental "things" that a particular data model is intended to represent. That is, a feature such as building could be represented alternatively as a Man-made Point Feature, a Radar RCS polar diagram or as an OpenFlight model, or some combination of these. The representation of these is chosen by the data modeler and is orthogonal to the semantic of the "thing" that is represented (and its location). The provision of such a "thing" results in a shared understanding of "what the thing is and what it potentially means" to all participating applications.
|*Environmental Data Representation Model* |A data representation model (EDRM) is a description used to provide identification of all environmental data elements within a system, including their attributes and the logical relationships between data elements.
|*Environmental DB, Runtime* |A device-loadable database format that can be processed by a target device. The CDB Standard defines a format that can be entered in runtime by simulator client-devices that conform to the CDB Standard.
|*Eyepoint* |A single point (monocular) location of the observer’s eye relative to a scene representation. Usually a point within the cockpit of the simulated aircraft or vehicle.
|*Eyepoint, Pilot* |The normal eyepoint position when the pilot’s seat is adjusted properly for flying the aircraft. Defined by the aircraft manufacturer for each pilot seating position.
